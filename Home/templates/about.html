                    <p> Classical Cryptography
The roots are cryptography are found in Roman and Egyptian civilizations. Below are some of the ancient types of cryptography:
1. Hieroglyphs Cryptography: The earliest known use of Cryptography can be dated back to 1900 BCE during the time of the Old Kingdom of Egypt in form of non-standard hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs were a secret form of communication that the Egyptians used to communicate with one another. This secret text was known only to the scribes of the kings who used to transmit messages on their behalf. 
2. Caesar Cipher: The ancient Greeks were well known for the use of Ciphers. The Caesar Cipher or Shift Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest well-known cryptographic techniques as it was used by Julius Caesar. It is a form of Substitution Cipher where each character in a word is replaced by a fixed number of positions. For example with a shift of 3, A is replaced by D, B by E, and so on. 
3. Vigenere Cipher: During the 16th century, Vigenere designed a cipher in which the encryption key is repeated multiple times spanning the entire message, and then the cipher text is generated by adding the message character with key character modulo 26. This approach is also vulnerable to attacks, where the secrecy of the message depends on the secrecy of the encryption key.  
4. Hebern rotating machine: At the start of the 19th century, Hebern designed a Hebern rotating machine. In this machine, a single rotor is used where the secret key is embedded in the rotating disc and the key has an embedded substitution table. Each key press from the keyboard resulted in the output of cipher text. This code is broken by using the letter frequencies.
5. Enigma machine: Cryptography played a vital in the victory of Allied forces during World War I and World War II. World War II prominently saw the use of electromechanical cipher machines. The story of the Allied victory over the Germans by cracking the world-famous Enigma machine is well known. Like all rotor machines, Enigma is a combination of electro-mechanical subsystems. It consisted of somewhat three to five rotors. Whenever a key was pressed, one or more rotors rotated on the spindle, and accordingly, the key was scrambled to something else. The Enigma cipher was broken by Poland.
